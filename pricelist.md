Note: excellent cheaper choices that do not offer as much but can do some of the course are:

1. [Seeduino XAIO 7](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html) $7.00 USD really cheap but can't do much combined abilities

1. [Nano 33 Ble Sense](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-33-ble-sense) $31.10 USD With lots of builtin sensors including accelrometer thi sboard can do a  lot

1. [Nano RP2040 Connect](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-rp2040-connect-with-headers) $25.50 first ever raspberry Pi with Wifi and BLE by Arduino. This board has a lot of promise, just to new for me to have everything working.






### Lots of other boards that you might consider working with






### Platforms to consider. Note: These are mainly all free

1. [Regular Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

1. New [Arduino (PRO) IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/arduino-pro-ide) An updated but has a few bugs of the old IDE

1. [Arduino Cloud IDE](https://store.arduino.cc/digital/create) From Free and from $3-$24 a month

1. [platformIO](https://platformio.org/)  uses Visual Studio Code

1. C++ compiler - (Possibility with Gitpod) My one here (not yet easy) [https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-of-edge-impulse](https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-gitpod-of-edge-impulse)

1. [OpenMV-micropython](https://openmv.io/) Free for Portenta and the Nano33BleSense

1. [Lauterbach TRACE32](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/tutorials/portenta-h7/por-ard-trace32) Professional Debugger Free for Portenta and the Nano33BleSense

1. [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/) (not yet available for Portenta) Free

1. [Visuino](https://www.visuino.com/login) (Not yet available for the Portenta)  $39 one time fee but for only 4 months of updates.



















Total cost = 



1. 3D Printer I have the [Tinkerine](https://store.tinkerine.com/) and a 12x12x12 [Raise3D N2 V2](https://www.amazon.com/Raise3D-Plus-Printer-Dual-Extruder/dp/B01N3982HD) but any working 3D Printer would be fine.
